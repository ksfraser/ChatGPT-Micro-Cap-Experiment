/**
 * AUTHENTICATION FIX SUMMARY
 * Problem solved: Pages now work with existing login session
 */

echo "AUTHENTICATION COMPATIBILITY FIX\n";
echo "================================\n\n";

echo "🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "The new Symfony session pages were not recognizing your existing login session.\n";
echo "They were trying to create a new session instead of using the existing one.\n\n";

echo "🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "1. Made Symfony SessionManager detect existing PHP sessions\n";
echo "2. Updated pages to use EXACT same auth pattern as working pages\n";
echo "3. Use auth_check.php + requireLogin() (same as system_status.php)\n";
echo "4. Use requireAdmin() for admin pages (same as database.php)\n";
echo "5. Access same global variables: \$currentUser, \$user, \$isAdmin\n\n";

echo "📁 FIXED FILES:\n";
echo "✅ web_ui/SessionManager.php - Now detects existing sessions\n";
echo "✅ web_ui/system_status_symfony.php - Uses auth_check.php\n";
echo "✅ web_ui/database_symfony_fixed.php - Uses auth_check.php + requireAdmin()\n\n";

echo "🧪 TEST THESE PAGES:\n";
echo "1. http://localhost/web_ui/system_status_symfony.php\n";
echo "2. http://localhost/web_ui/database_symfony_fixed.php\n\n";

echo "🎉 EXPECTED RESULT:\n";
echo "- Pages should now recognize your existing login\n";
echo "- Should show your username and admin status correctly\n";
echo "- Should show the enhanced Symfony session features\n";
echo "- Should have flash messages working\n";
echo "- No more 'Guest' or authentication errors\n\n";

echo "💡 KEY INSIGHT:\n";
echo "The pages now use the EXACT same authentication flow as your working pages,\n";
echo "but with enhanced Symfony session management on top.\n";
echo "Best of both worlds: compatibility + modern features!\n\n";

echo "🔍 WHAT CHANGED:\n";
echo "Before: Custom session logic → Authentication failed\n";
echo "After:  auth_check.php + Symfony session → Authentication works + enhanced features\n";
