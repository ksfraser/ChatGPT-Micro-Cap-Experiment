/**
 * Available Symfony Security Extensions
 * For your future enterprise authentication needs
 */

echo "AVAILABLE SYMFONY SECURITY EXTENSIONS\n";
echo "====================================\n\n";

echo "📦 WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE:\n";
echo "✅ symfony/security-core      # Core security functionality\n";
echo "✅ symfony/security-csrf      # CSRF protection\n";
echo "✅ symfony/http-foundation    # Session management\n";
echo "✅ symfony/password-hasher    # Modern password hashing\n\n";

echo "📦 WHAT YOU CAN ADD FOR ENTERPRISE AUTH:\n\n";

echo "🔐 LDAP/Active Directory:\n";
echo "composer require symfony/ldap\n";
echo "composer require symfony/security-ldap\n";
echo "- Connect to Windows Active Directory\n";
echo "- Support for multiple LDAP servers\n";
echo "- Automatic role mapping from LDAP groups\n";
echo "- Failover to database if LDAP unavailable\n\n";

echo "🌐 OAuth2/OpenID Connect (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.):\n";
echo "composer require knpuniversity/oauth2-client-bundle\n";
echo "composer require league/oauth2-google\n";
echo "composer require league/oauth2-azure\n";
echo "composer require league/oauth2-github\n";
echo "- Single Sign-On with major providers\n";
echo "- Automatic user provisioning\n";
echo "- Role mapping from OAuth claims\n\n";

echo "🏢 SAML SSO (Enterprise Identity Providers):\n";
echo "composer require simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp\n";
echo "- ADFS (Microsoft)\n";
echo "- Okta\n";
echo "- Auth0\n";
echo "- PingIdentity\n";
echo "- OneLogin\n";
echo "- Any SAML 2.0 compliant IdP\n\n";

echo "🔑 JWT API Authentication:\n";
echo "composer require lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle\n";
echo "- Stateless API authentication\n";
echo "- Token refresh mechanisms\n";
echo "- Role-based API access\n";
echo "- Mobile app authentication\n\n";

echo "🛡️ Two-Factor Authentication:\n";
echo "composer require scheb/2fa-bundle\n";
echo "- TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)\n";
echo "- SMS-based 2FA\n";
echo "- Email-based 2FA\n";
echo "- Backup codes\n\n";

echo "📱 Additional Security Features:\n";
echo "composer require symfony/rate-limiter      # Rate limiting\n";
echo "composer require symfony/security-http     # HTTP authentication\n";
echo "composer require symfony/security-bundle   # Full security integration\n\n";

echo "🏗️ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:\n\n";

echo "Month 1-2: Foundation\n";
echo "├── Keep your existing Ksfraser\\Auth system\n";
echo "├── Add symfony/security-bundle for future expansion\n";
echo "└── Plan authentication requirements\n\n";

echo "Month 3-4: Add Enterprise Auth (as needed)\n";
echo "├── symfony/ldap for Active Directory\n";
echo "├── OR oauth2-client-bundle for SSO\n";
echo "├── OR simplesamlphp for SAML\n";
echo "└── Test with pilot users\n\n";

echo "Month 5-6: Advanced Features\n";
echo "├── JWT for API access\n";
echo "├── Two-factor authentication\n";
echo "├── Rate limiting\n";
echo "└── Security auditing\n\n";

echo "🎯 REAL-WORLD ENTERPRISE SCENARIOS:\n\n";

echo "Scenario 1: Corporate with Active Directory\n";
echo "Problem: 1000+ employees need to use existing AD credentials\n";
echo "Solution: symfony/ldap + symfony/security-ldap\n";
echo "Benefit: Single sign-on, no new passwords, automatic role sync\n\n";

echo "Scenario 2: SaaS with Multiple Customers\n";
echo "Problem: Each customer wants their own SSO (Okta, Auth0, etc.)\n";
echo "Solution: simplesamlphp with multi-tenant configuration\n";
echo "Benefit: Each customer can use their preferred identity provider\n\n";

echo "Scenario 3: Mobile App + Web Portal\n";
echo "Problem: Need API authentication for mobile apps\n";
echo "Solution: lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle\n";
echo "Benefit: Stateless authentication, secure mobile access\n\n";

echo "Scenario 4: High-Security Environment\n";
echo "Problem: Need 2FA and advanced security features\n";
echo "Solution: scheb/2fa-bundle + symfony/rate-limiter\n";
echo "Benefit: Multi-layer security, compliance ready\n\n";

echo "💡 MIGRATION STRATEGY:\n";
echo "1. Your existing users keep working (zero downtime)\n";
echo "2. Add new authentication methods alongside existing\n";
echo "3. Gradually move users to new methods\n";
echo "4. Retire old methods when everyone migrated\n\n";

echo "Example user flow:\n";
echo "Week 1: John logs in with database password (existing)\n";
echo "Week 2: John logs in with LDAP (new option added)\n";
echo "Week 3: John uses SSO (database password disabled for him)\n\n";

echo "🏆 END RESULT:\n";
echo "One authentication system that supports:\n";
echo "✅ Database users (existing customers)\n";
echo "✅ LDAP users (employees)\n";
echo "✅ SSO users (enterprise customers)\n";
echo "✅ API users (mobile apps, integrations)\n";
echo "✅ 2FA users (high-security requirements)\n";
echo "✅ Future authentication methods (as they emerge)\n\n";

echo "All managed by battle-tested Symfony Security components.\n";
echo "No custom code to maintain, full enterprise feature set!\n";
