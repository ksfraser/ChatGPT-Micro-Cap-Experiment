# Database Schema Update Summary

## Overview

Successfully updated the database schema to follow the per-symbol table architecture as requested. The system now splits data by stocks (symbols) into their own individual tables for improved file size management and backup performance.

## Updated Files

### 1. StockTableManager.php
**Enhanced existing table templates:**
- **historical_prices** (_{symbol}_prices): Added multi-exchange support with fields for exchange, currency, data quality tracking, bid/ask spreads, VWAP, and technical price components
- **technical_indicators** (_{symbol}_indicators): Added advanced indicator components including Bollinger Bands (upper_band, lower_band), MACD (signal_line, histogram), ADX (plus_di, minus_di), Aroon (aroon_up, aroon_down), Stochastic (k_percent, d_percent), accuracy tracking, and trend classification
- **dividends** (_{symbol}_dividends): Added comprehensive dividend analysis including tax status, yield calculations, payout ratios, growth rates, coverage ratios, franking credits, and adjustment factors

**Added new table templates:**
- **splits** (_{symbol}_splits): Stock split tracking with adjustment factors, announcement dates, and split type classification
- **risk_metrics** (_{symbol}_risk_metrics): Comprehensive risk analysis including VaR calculations, performance ratios, volatility metrics, and statistical measures
- **shannon_analysis** (_{symbol}_shannon): Shannon probability analysis with market persistence, mean reversion detection, and information theory calculations
- **backtest_results** (_{symbol}_backtests): Strategy backtesting results with performance attribution, trade statistics, and risk-adjusted metrics
- **correlation_data** (_{symbol}_correlations): Inter-symbol correlation analysis with multiple correlation types and statistical significance testing

### 2. legacy_software_analysis.md
Updated the requirements document to reflect the per-symbol table architecture with detailed schema specifications for each table type.

### 3. enhanced_architecture.md
Created comprehensive architecture documentation detailing:
- Per-symbol database design principles
- Enhanced service layer architecture
- API endpoint specifications
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and monitoring considerations

### 4. README.md
Updated the main README to highlight the enhanced capabilities and professional-grade features added to the system.

## Per-Symbol Table Architecture

Each stock symbol (e.g., 'AAPL') now gets its own set of tables:
- `AAPL_prices` - Enhanced historical price data
- `AAPL_indicators` - Advanced technical indicators with accuracy tracking
- `AAPL_dividends` - Comprehensive dividend analysis
- `AAPL_splits` - Stock split history with adjustment factors
- `AAPL_earnings` - Earnings data and estimates
- `AAPL_patterns` - Chart pattern recognition
- `AAPL_support_resistance` - Support/resistance levels
- `AAPL_signals` - Trading signals
- `AAPL_risk_metrics` - Risk analysis data
- `AAPL_shannon` - Shannon probability analysis
- `AAPL_backtests` - Strategy backtesting results
- `AAPL_correlations` - Inter-symbol correlation data

## Benefits of Per-Symbol Architecture

1. **File Size Management**: Large datasets split across multiple smaller tables
2. **Backup Optimization**: Individual symbol data can be backed up independently
3. **Query Performance**: Symbol-specific queries run faster on smaller datasets
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple symbols can be analyzed concurrently
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new symbols without affecting existing data

## Enhanced Features Added

### Technical Analysis
- 50+ professional indicators from legacy financial software analysis
- Accuracy tracking with statistical confidence levels
- Advanced indicator components (Bollinger Bands, MACD, ADX, Aroon, Stochastic)
- Trend direction classification and indicator type categorization

### Risk Management
- Value at Risk (VaR) calculations at multiple confidence levels
- Performance ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar) with statistical validation
- Comprehensive volatility analysis including skewness and kurtosis
- Beta/alpha calculations for market sensitivity analysis

### Shannon Probability Analysis
- Information theory-based market analysis
- Hurst exponent for market persistence detection
- Mean reversion analysis and half-life calculations
- Kelly optimization for portfolio allocation

### Professional Backtesting
- Strategy framework with configurable parameters
- Performance attribution analysis vs. benchmarks
- Trade statistics with win/loss ratios and consecutive run analysis
- Commission and slippage cost modeling

### Data Quality & Multi-Exchange Support
- Exchange-specific data with currency conversion
- Data quality scoring and validation
- Multi-timeframe analysis capabilities
- Historical adjustment factors for splits and dividends

## Next Steps

The database schema is now fully updated to support the enhanced financial analysis capabilities while maintaining the per-symbol architecture for optimal performance. The system is ready for:

1. Integration with the enhanced service classes (AdvancedTechnicalIndicators, PortfolioRiskManager, etc.)
2. API endpoint implementation for the new analytics capabilities
3. Professional dashboard integration with the advanced metrics
4. Testing and validation of the new table structures

All requirements documents and architecture documentation have been updated to reflect the new per-symbol approach as requested.
